		<h2>Team Fundraising</h2>
		    <p>
		        In order to offset the majority of costs associated with growing and maintaining a top-level
                team, it is necessary for many teams to carry out fundraisers. The team manager may facilitate
                a number of fundraising events. Fundraising events could include general donations from the
                community. The greater the amount of fundraising, the less parents will be required to
                contribute as part of the team fees. All parents are expected to participate to the greatest
                extent possible. To comply with IRS regulations, any funds received through a team fundraiser
                must benefit all players equally.
                The WTB does not allow advertisements or sponsorships from tobacco, alcoholic beverage,
                adult entertainment or other companies that may serve as a bad example for participants.
                The WTB Directorâ€™s reserve the right to deny sponsorship or affiliation with the program or
                any team to any company or organization which they feels does not serve as a good
                example. Funds raised via fundraising are to be managed by the team manager and/or team
                treasurer.
                WTB may seek corporate sponsorships for the club as a whole. In order to avoid having
                multiple teams approaching the same potential corporate sponsors, individual teams should
                not seek corporate sponsors as a rule. If a team becomes aware of a potential corporate
                sponsor, that information should be shared with the Directors. Corporate sponsorships may
                be divided amongst the teams at the discretion of the Directors based on various criteria, but
                may not be equally divided amongst all teams.
